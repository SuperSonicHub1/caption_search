00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.069
Gamers Nexus is an upscaling addict.
My brother caught them in the act of upscaling

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.580
their benchmarks, thanks to tell-tale artifacts
present in the image. Now, thereâ€™s nothing

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.680
wrong with them doing this- I actively encourage
as many people to become upscaling addicts

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.419
as possible, because it helps enable me.
I upscale all kinds of stuff in my videos.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.109
I enjoy doing it simply to discover how the
results turn out. Sometimes, people notice

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.269
when Iâ€™ve upscaled an image! â€¦but for
every time this happens, there are 10 upscaled

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.789
images that go unnoticed. And the images that
people do notice are upscaled are typically

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.520
so blurry and low-res in the first place that,
had I not upscaled it, people would have asked

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.510
me why I hadnâ€™t done so.
So yeah, without meaning to blow my own trumpet

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.530
too much, Iâ€™m pretty fucking awesome at
upscaling these days. So let me give Gamersnexus,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.359
and any other upscaling wannabes out there,
some tips!

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.100
First of all- itâ€™s best not to upscale if
you can help it. Although I love upscaling,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.809
I capture my stuff on a 4K screen to avoid
having to in the first place! Of course, Gamers

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.329
Nexus already knows that bigger images are
better. Theyâ€™re just having problems with

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.820
their software, so have been â€˜forcedâ€™
to upscale the images, which no doubt takes

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.580
them more time to do, and results in an inferior
image than a native result would achieve.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.479
Secondly, the upscaling algorithm you choose
will greatly dictate the quality of the resulting

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.640
upscale. Looking at the upscaled Gamersnexus
image, the writing really gives away that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.960
itâ€™s been upscaled; the letters donâ€™t
retain an even thickness. Some weird stuff

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.939
is going on with the â€˜Mâ€™ here where the
lines converge. And there are dark or green

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.590
halos around some of the numbers! Classic
upscaling errors right there, often caused

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.490
by an upscaler thatâ€™s attempting to upscale
symbols as though theyâ€™re a tree, or person,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.110
or car and is applying copious amounts of
sharpening to the result.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.000
Much better for this kind of image is an algorithm
trained on upscaling graphs, or linesâ€¦ or

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.150
waifus. I mean, an algorithm thatâ€™s endured
300,000 generations of waifus is going to

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.400
do great with something as simple as a few
lines and curves!

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.560
I went and got THIS low-res benchmark from
the gamersnexus site to upscale.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.170
Weâ€™ll start with some inappropriate upscaling.
Gigapixel. This program- bless its heart-

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.391
is great if youâ€™re upscaling, say, an eagleâ€¦
eating aâ€¦ fish. But it isnâ€™t so great

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:16.580
for line images. Even with the line or art
presets! Upscaling it using â€˜artâ€™ is,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.440
frankly, horrible. The standard setting is
a lot better, but still fails to produce a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.750
crisp, clear result.
The free website version of Waifu2x produces

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.670
a far superior image. Despite creating 16
pixels for every 1 that originally existed,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.310
there isnâ€™t a hint of pixilation in sight!
However, the text becomes a bit hand-drawn

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.041
in style, and suffers slightly from coloured
halos. But itâ€™s a good upscale. Especially

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:44.170
for one thatâ€™s obtainable in just a few
kilks online. Just be warned that there is

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.900
a size limit, so if youâ€™re wanting 4K results
then you may run into these restrictions.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.880
Using cupscale running the catchily named
â€˜foolhardy remacri extrasmootherâ€™ algorithm,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.830
I THINK does a much better job on the text-
but it comes at the cost of colour clarity,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.680
which seems to bleed slightly into its surroundings
in a subtle way. As though the whole image

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.019
is being smoothed by an extra amount. Itâ€™s
a real shame. If only there was a version

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.860
of this that wasnâ€™t extrasmooth.
Lastly, I tried the UltraYandere algorithm,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.489
which delivers a sharper result, but in exchange
for a few extra bugs on the text. While I

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.239
initially gave the win to this one, after
further comparisons, I think the catchily

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:30.200
named foolhardy remacri extrasmoother is the
victor for producing the more consistent results.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.720
Oh hey, letâ€™s try Foolhardy Remacri without
the extrasmoother. Oh yes, thatâ€™s better.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.840
In conclusion: when you have a blurry, low-res
graph, Foolhardy Remacri extrasmoother is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.209
a big improvement, but produces a soft result.
Yandere Ultra is much sharper, but comes with

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.251
a few bugs. But Foolhardy Remacri is JUST
right, and looks amazing. Gamersnexus, use

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.251
this one pls ðŸ˜Š

00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:57.159
Letâ€™s move onto another benchmark- which
is much more similar in appearance to the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.610
one that Gamersnexus attempted to upscale.
As before, gigapixel mutilates the image.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.079
Waifu2xâ€™s is acceptable but a bit blobby,
UltraYandere I think delivers a slightly better

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.549
result, tarnished by the slightest whiff of
waifu, but again itâ€™s the catchily named

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.050
foolhardy remacri that I think is the best
all-rounder. It correctly preserves the shapes

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.330
of edges, the graph looks graphy and the font
looks fonty. A great result, especially given

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.050
how low-res the original was!
So I have no idea how low-res the images are

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.840
that Gamersnexus is upscaling. Maybe theyâ€™re
already using the best upscaling solution,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.140
but are hampered by a super low-resolution
base image. Or maybe -just MAYBE- they should

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.590
provide me with the base images and let me
experiment with the various upscaling methods

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.220
until I find one that looks the best. Come
on, Gamersnexus. You know itâ€™s the right

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.080
thing to do.
Letâ€™s unite and upscale the world together.
